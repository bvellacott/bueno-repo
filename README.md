# bueno-repo
bueno mono repo solution

## mono repos are too hard
the solution should be simple - after all, all I want is to have my libraries in the same git repo as my main app

## aliases are all I need
all I really need is aliases and an easy way to set them up, the my test/dev code can read the aliases to resolve
modules from within the directory structure rather than looking up an external service like npm
